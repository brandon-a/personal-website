			<p>Hi, I'm Brandon, I am currently a Computer Science student at De Anza College. I've always been interested in computers and became interested in Computer Science when I took an elective Java programming class in high school and loved it. Since then I have continued my studies at De Anza primarily focusing on C++. I will be transferring soon to complete a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
				
			In the past I have worked as an IT technician in which I was able to resolve many client issues and gain a better understanding of how users use products and what features are beneficial to ease of use. I think my experience in IT allowed me to become a better problem solver. I plan on using this knowledge to build more intuitive applications as well as understanding the needs of users and implementing those features into software I build.</p>
